### Live Transformer
This plugin allows you to prototype a TypeScript AST transformer in the playground.

Use `Transform` tab to run your transformer and use other useful development tools.

Some information on how to implement a transformer can be found at:
- [TypeScript wiki - Using the Compiler API](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Compiler-API)
- [TypeScript Transformer Handbook](https://github.com/madou/typescript-transformer-handbook)

There is a lot of information and expertise not written down anywhere, a great place to start is the [TypeScript Community Discord](https://discord.gg/typescript) and its `#compiler-internals-and-api` channel. Feel free to ask your questions there.
